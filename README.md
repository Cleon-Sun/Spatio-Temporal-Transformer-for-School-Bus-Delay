# Predicting School Bus Delays in New York City üöåüè´

This project focuses on predicting school bus delays in New York City by leveraging the power of advanced machine learning models. Specifically, I replicated a spatio-temporal transformer model originally developed in TensorFlow using PyTorch, capturing the complex spatial and temporal correlations between schools. This innovative approach enables more accurate predictions by accounting for the dynamic nature of traffic and urban environments.

## Key Highlights

- **Model Replication**: Utilized PyTorch to successfully replicate a spatio-temporal transformer model initially implemented in TensorFlow.
- **Spatial and Temporal Correlations**: Captured varying spatial correlations over time between different schools, enhancing model accuracy.
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved an impressive Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 8 minutes per week.
- **Impact**: This project demonstrates the potential of advanced machine learning models to improve urban transportation systems and enhance the reliability of school bus services.

## Project Overview

### Motivation
The reliability of school bus services is crucial for students' daily commutes and overall school experience. Predicting bus delays accurately can significantly reduce the stress and uncertainty associated with school transportation, ensuring that students arrive on time and ready to learn.

### Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Gathered historical bus delay data along with spatial information about school locations in New York City.
- **Model Architecture**: Implemented a spatio-temporal transformer model using PyTorch to capture both spatial and temporal correlations between schools.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Trained the model on historical data, optimizing it to achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 8 minutes per week.

### Results
The model's predictions are highly accurate, making it a valuable tool for improving school bus routing and scheduling in urban environments. This approach can potentially be scaled to other cities, contributing to smarter urban transportation systems.
